djv0ax0,innisfree super volcanic clay mask,clay mask,best,"thoughts i use a clay mask at least once a week, i find it really helps with mattifying my skin. this is one of the best clay masks that i've found. it's affordable, applies easily and does mattify. the negative side is that it's messy to wash off, and i prefer tubes to pots. though they do do a bottle version which i've yet to try.",oily,8,2,0
djv702q,belif aqua bomb,moisturizer,best,"i love this stuff. it's a gel cream that sinks into my skin amazingly. my skin hates most moistuizers, and i hate the feeling of a thick cream, but this one feels just like water. it keeps my skin hydrated, has a cooling effect, and a refreshing scent that i would describe as slightly minty. mine came in a jar but if i remember correctly they're switching to tube packaging, which is a plus for a lot of people.",oily,4,1,0

djv4eeq,missha super aqua ultra water-full clear cream,moisturizer,best,"thoughts using this gel-type moisturizer at night daily has really helped control excess oil on my face and reduced my breakouts. the next morning my skin seems smoother and a lot for matte. after applying it your face may look excessively shiny/sticky, but for me, my skin soon absorbed it pretty well so it wasn't a problem. i like to use this after using a thicker emulsion/moisturizer(so this gel is the very last step) to add an extra layer of hydration to my face.",oily,3,0,0
djuzzcn,innisfree no sebum powder - loose,make up,best,"thoughts love this affordable powder! i dust it on my face with the puff, quite generously, and it helps my skin look matte during the day! i usually have to top up every 5-6 hours in summer but less in winter. it does leave a slight white cast if you're too heavy handed with it, so be wary of that.",oily,8,2,5
djv05rw,elizavecca 24k gold water drop cream mask,moisturiser,best,"thoughts this is a lightweight gel from elizavecca which comes in a hefty tube. it smells citrusy and has a cool water drop effect when you apply it. by which i mean it comes out as a cream, but quickly rubs in and looks like you've splashed yourself with water before it absorbs. which it does quickly. i recommend this to oily skinned people as it's super lightweight, but still hydrating.",oily,1,0,0
djvlvej,pyungkang yul mist toner,hydrating toner,best,"thoughts: this product is how i'm surviving summer. i turn into a real grouch in the heat because it makes me feel so uncomfortable. i have naturally very oily skin and quite a mane of dark hair, which i feel like just absorbs all the heat. this mist comes with me every day and has become part of my midday post-work ritual of blotting paper and misting. it dries down to nothing and feels so refreshing, it's like a temperature reset on my face. also, its got like 5 ingredients total, coptis japonica root extract being the absolute star. it comes in this beautiful blue bottle as well. happy happy happy that this is in my life. ",oily,3,1,0
djvedyg,cosrx aloe vera oil-free moisture cream,moisturizer,best,"thoughts: i've been using this cream, which is really a gel, for over two years now. it's the only thing that i've found to be hydrating and not overly shiny (especially under makeup). it has a bit of a cooling effect so it's perfect for summer. you know how sometimes applying moisturizer in humid weather can cause you to sweat under your nose right after? that doesn't happen with this moisturizer. the ingredients are also gentle and don't clog my pores. sometimes in the winter i'll mix a drop of oil to make it more hydrating.",oily,2,0,0
djvpgxn,zymogen houttyunia cordata serum and lotion,toner and moisturiser,best,"i've pretty much used at least 4 sets of these in the last 1+years and they are irreplaceable. they help control oil production, brighten (licorice root) and hydrate without clogging my skin. in fact, i think they have corrected the oil balance of my cheeks from oily to normal.",oily,1,0,0
djv8nyi,neogen black volume cream,sleeping pack/moisturizer,best,"i had purchased this in a shady skinfood brick and mortar store due to the fact that the packaging said that the ingredients were listed inside the box and that at the time, i could find absolutely no information about it. i figured that if i saw one of my skin triggers that i would just return it the same day. when i finally looked at the ingredient list, it was, pretty crazy. crazy long with over 120 ingredients. at the time, my routine could've used a lot of help to begin with so adding it in didn't do much. fast-foward to today, where my routine actually makes a degree of sense, i use it as my pm sleeping pack and i wake up with very glowy skin with my dehydration lines nowhere to be found.",oily,1,0,0
djvkyzy,the history of whoo wrinkle essentual cream,special needs/cream/eye cream,worst,"thoughts i got this to deal with small wrinkles around my eyes and my nasolabial folds; it's supposed to be used at last stages of skincare as both wrinkle filler and anti-age product. it comes with a few patches that can be used to seal in the product; for me it worked even without patches, i can't complain about the effectiveness. my issue with it is that it's so heavy and occlusive i started developing milia and whiteheads under my skin in the areas where i was applying it; i hated that because i saw results almost immediately. i tried using it every other day, then only a couple times a week, but finally i had to give it up. it's probably perfect for dry/normal skin, but it's not suitable for oily skin, however effective it is.  ",oily,1,0,0
djvkgfh,shiseido pureness deep cleansing foam  ,cleanser  ,worst  ,"this foam cleanser stripped every bit of moisture from my oily face to the point that it was physically painful. i didn't notice any effect on oil control because i would have to super-rehydrate my skin every time i used this cleanser. also, the blue ""purifying granules"" are large and hard enough to be irritating but too sparsely dispersed in the foam to do any good for physical exfoliation. ",oily,1,0,0
djwf33s,country & stream honey uv water gel spf50+ pa++++,sunscreen,best,"thoughts: i am not saying this is the best sunscreen out there for oily skin, but it is great if you're looking for an alcohol-free one. when i first got this, i was worried it would be too hydrating, shiny, etc. but i wanted to try an alcohol-free alternative to the biore uv aqua essence since my skin tends to be dehydrated as well. i love this. it's hydrating, yes, but it sinks in fast and it doesn't make me oilier. it has a satin finish and wears really well under makeup. it has a light scent that reminds me of honey cough drops. it's a little harder to get outside of japan but try it if you can get your hands on it. i prefer this over the canmake mermaid gel.",oily,2,0,0

dk8a8it,rosehip oil,moisturizer,best for immediate relief from stretches of hella dry skin and general use moisturizer ,"thoughts: for the last six months i've been battling these dry flaky patches of skin around my mouth and the only thing that gave me acute relief was pm application of rosehip oil. my patches are finally gone (bless) thanks to an unrelated change in routine, but rosehip oil was the only thing to relieve my sad flaky patches. now, aside from using it to treat immediate concerns, it's a great moisturizer in general for my dry skin. i like mixing it in a cream moisturizer or just straight up applying to my face before bed, and i often wake up with plump (not thirsting for anything) happy skin. it's definitely become a staple in my stockpile.

dk9cye8,product: mizon black snail aio,moisturizer,best,"thoughts: i love this moisturizer! it's rich and feels great putting on, but isn't greasy or anything. it absorbs right away. i haven't tried the normal mizon snail aio so i can't i can't compare, but i've read that the normal snail is more of a whipped texture and this one is a bit heavier. i liked the ingredient list better on the black snail (niacinimide) which is why i tried this one first.

dk8c0g5,product name: koh gen do oriental plants soap ,step: cleanser,best,"thoughts: this is truly a hidden gem. i have not seen anyone here talk about or recommend this soap but it's truly a gem. this soap has never dried me out even on the worst of worst dry days. it is gentle and the scent is just beautiful. if you find a lot of hanbang products too hanbangy try this one out! it's a little pricey-i think nordstrom sells it for $55.00, but i've used it daily at night for two months and i'm slightly more than halfway through it.

i have some of the driest skin i've ever heard of on a young person, and this has been such a treat for my skin. it keeps me flake-free and smooth all day, doesn't pill or separate under makeup, and is not greasy feeling in the swampy korean summer. my skin is much less reactive and looks better even when i'm not actually wearing this cream (like immediately after washing). it's not even expensive, though it is comparitively hard to find (being a smaller brand -- but you can get it at watsons). i <3 it so much.",dry,1,0,1
dk8mrvd,botanic farm grain ferment cleansing sherbet ,1st step cleanser ,best,this stuff is my hg of cleaning balms. once you scoop the amount out with the provided spatula it melts on your face taking all your makeup with it. it's really good about getting mascara off too. i have very dry acne prone skin. this helps keep moisture in especially since i double cleanse with murad time release acne cleanser (which surprising doesn't dry me out). ,dry,2,0,0

dk9i3gu,product whamisa organic flowers toner,toner ,worst,thoughts i purchased this because i've read and seen blog posts saying how wonderful it is. i have been using koh gen do lotion i as a hydrating toner for a couple of months now and wanted to see if there was an alternative. well. this is definitely not it. i put it on and had such a severe reaction to it: it burned. as in burned. my face got red and i got a rash. i was stunned with the reaction honestly. there was nothing positive about it-not even the scent. the koh gen do lotion i is my staple. i actually took off the little stopper and up ended the entire bottle down the sink. there's no way i'm passing this one on.  i'm very unfamiliar with hydrating toners but my first foray outside of the one i have been using wasn't very positive. ,dry,2,0,0
dk8maj3,innisfree rice sleeping pack capsule ,moisturizer,best,"i love this sleeping pack because i have dry, acne-prone skin and use tretinoin. i often find myself with flaky patches. it has little to no scent. my skin is pretty sensitive and i had no reaction to it. i think the consistency is my favorite part, it feels moisturizing without feeling heavy. i plan on purchasing more as i received one from a friend. one capsule goes a long way!",dry,1,0,0
dkirecs,i'm from ginseng wash off mask,wash-off detox mask,best,"i like this a lot. as directed, i used this on a wet face after cleansing, and washed off after 20-25 min. this is meant to be a detoxing mask, but it is also moisturizing, and it remains the best method i have found for me to use bha and aha without dryness or irritation/tingling. my skin responds favourably to acids and it decreases my breakouts a lot, but since my skin tends to be dry, usually even 5 minutes of waiting is a chore. when i use this mask before i start acids, i can do wait times without a problem. the next couple of days i sheet mask more if needed, since detox mask+acids = quite a bit of exfoliation.

dk8bnmi,product name: sk-ii facial treatment soap,step: cleanser ,worst,thoughts:  nowhere near as good as the essence and the toner. it dried me out. i initially thought that it was because i was double cleansing twice daily (when i started ab). i put it aside and then went back to it after my skin improved and i eliminated double cleansing x daily. it still dried me out. i used the remainder as a body wash. ,dry,1,0,0

dlzz95c,benton snail bee high content steam cream,cream,best,"thoughts literally, this is my hg cream to seal in all my hydration layers. it's thick enough to occlude everything, but not overtly so thick that my skin feels congested. in fact, this was my first product that gave me that chok-chok feeling. my only (but biggest) pet peeve about it is the preservation system. i know that benton messed up pretty bad in the past but people still love the products because dammit, it works. however, because my skin tends to get more stressed during the summer, i really need this cream to come through. but the heat will destroy it for sure (when it ships over), so i've been trying to find a product that gives me that hydration plump skin feeling. i found it in a sample of skinfood's [aqua grape bounce cream] (http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/geoplee/7502_aqua_grape_bounce_cream.jpg) but it's not available for shipping to the states and the price...i saw it going for 30,000 won in korea last month!",combination,1,0,0
