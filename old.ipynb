      "I've noticed some misunderstanding around various skin care subs about what, exactly, hydrocolloid bandages do. They don't actually suck the gunk out of pimples!  Initially, they were made for blisters before being repurposed for acne. They absorb moisture from the wound to form a gel, which is why the bandage rapidly turns into a soft and spongy mass which also cushions your wound. The gel on the bandage is also cohesive, which means it creates a seal and whatever leaks from your wound stays in place under the dressing, allowing the wound to heal quicker. So the white stuff on the bandage isn't pus or anything, it is the moisture of the wound interacting with hydrocolloid on the bandage, causing the white appearance. This also makes sense with why they suggest the wound to already by open in some form as the bandage needs to interact with fluid in order to properly form a seal. Once the bandage is mostly white you're supposed to change it because it will become permeable to outside moisture as the seal is broken. With this in mind, it is good to note that hydrocolloid bandages are not an effective means to combat CCs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I totally wish that they sucked pus and gunk out of blemishes, but that is neither their purpose nor how they work, and therefore not what you're seeing happening with the bandage. They allow the wound to heal quicker and in a better environment. \n",
